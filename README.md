# JPR Landing (Vite + React + Tailwind)

## Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit the printed local URL. The landing page is wired at `/` with routes for `/auth` and `/vision`.

## Notes
- Aliases are set: `@` -> `./src`
- Tailwind colors are driven by CSS variables (see `src/index.css`).
- `src/components/ui/button.jsx` is a lightweight shadcn-style button API.
- Replace the placeholders in `src/assets/` with your real images keeping the same filenames,
  or update imports in `src/pages/Index.jsx`.
